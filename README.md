MNIST Classifier (PyTorch)

This repository implements a handwritten digit classifier on the MNIST dataset using PyTorch, following an industry-style machine learning workflow. The project demonstrates end-to-end model development, including dataset loading with torchvision, model definition using nn.Module, training with modern optimizers, and evaluation on a held-out test set.

The goal of this project is to transition from a from-scratch neural network implementation to a production-realistic approach that mirrors how machine learning models are developed and trained in practice. The code emphasizes clarity, modularity, and best practices used in real-world ML systems.
